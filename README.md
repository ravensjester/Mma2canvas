# Mma2canvas
2017-01-30  
Not having any idea what I'm doing, I'm following simple-minded tutorials 
to use github to develop and share software, using Mathematica to develop 
web content. The initial focus is to develop Mathematica functions to 
co-generate images in Graphics[] and canvas. Maybe it'll turn out that I 
really want to be doing this on Wolfram Cloud, but I don't even know the 
questions yet.
